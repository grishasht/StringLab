 Few rock groups of the '80s broke down as many musical barriers and were as
 original as the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Creating an intoxicating new musical
 style by combining funk and punk rock together (with an explosive stage
 show to boot), the Chili Peppers spawned a slew of imitators in their wake,
 but still managed to be the leaders of the pack by the dawn of the 21st
 century. The roots of the band lay in a friendship forged by three school
 chums, Anthony Kiedis, Michael Balzary, and Hillel Slovak, while they attended
 Fairfax High School in California back in the late '70s/early '80s. While
 Balzary and Slovak showed great musical promise (on trumpet and guitar, respectively),
 Kiedis focused on poetry and acting during his high-school career. During this
 time, Slovak taught Balzary how to play bass, while the duo encouraged Kiedis to
 start putting his poetry to music, which he soon did. Influenced heavily by the
 burgeoning L.A. punk scene (the Germs, Black Flag, Fear, Minutemen, X, etc.) as
 well as funk (Parliament-Funkadelic, Sly & the Family Stone, etc.), the trio began
 to rehearse with another friend, drummer Jack Irons, leading to the formation of
 Tony Flow & the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem, a quartet that played
 strip bars along the Sunset Strip during the early '80s. It was during this time
 that the four honed their sound and live act (as they stumbled across a stage
 gimmick that would soon become their trademark -- performing on-stage completely
 naked, except for a tube sock covering a certain part of their anatomy). By 1983,
 Balzary had begun to go by the name "Flea," and the group changed its name to the
 Red Hot Chili Peppers.
